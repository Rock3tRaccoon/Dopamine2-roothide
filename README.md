# Should I use Roothide?

In General no. Roothide is meant for Researchers. The reasoning behind this being roothide only focuses on one thing, Hiding the jailbreak. This is 
useful for researchers, bug bounty hunters etc. 
The everyday user is looking for springboard injection (Tweaks that modify the springboard in anyway, ex. Cylinder) Roothide doesnt support this.
